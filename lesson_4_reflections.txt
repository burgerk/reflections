Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are github clones,  used to clone a repos one cannot contribute to (or should not)
Clones are copies of repoisitories,  made from remote repsoitories or local
branches are series of commits within a repos.  Use to organize development tracks within a repository
